I'll add a .gitignore file in the backend directory. First, let me check if there's a backend directory and if it already has a .gitignore file.

I see there's already a .gitignore file in the backend directory, but it appears to be empty (0 bytes). Let me update it with standard Node.js .gitignore contents and make sure it includes .env files.

Read file: backend/.gitignore
I'll create a comprehensive .gitignore file for the backend directory that includes .env files:

```1:1:backend/.gitignore
# Dependencies
node_modules
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
package-lock.json

# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# Logs
logs
*.log

# Runtime data
pids
*.pid
*.seed
*.pid.lock

# Directory for instrumented libs generated by jscoverage/JSCover
lib-cov

# Coverage directory used by tools like istanbul
coverage

# Build outputs
dist
build

# Misc
.DS_Store
.idea
.vscode
*.suo
*.ntvs*
*.njsproj
*.sln
*.sw?
```
